# Recipe Post

This project was developed with the sole idea of creating a tamplete for writing recipes to publish on any social network. It is built using mostly PHP with some use of javacritpt with AJAX for the search function.


# Add ingredients

The functionality is quite simple, the user types in the macros of a particular food and "submits" them to the table on the left, once all the ingredients are added, the "Recipe title" input box is filled in and by pressing "Generate" the recipe is created as an image.

# Search

Previously used ingredients can be searched for using the "Search" bar and once this happens, the other inputs for filling in the macros are automatically filled in with the macros of the ingredient searched for.

# Recipe image

This is the layout for the recipe generated by the "Genarate" button. The total amount of calories in the given recipe is calculated by the project based on the macros entered
